o	Create a function that accepts numbers as an attribute and can limit the number of records. 
o	The functionality should accept a number and retrieve first n records (e.g., providing number `15` I should receive 15 first records from API). Please do this using C#


Creating a function in C# to retrieve the first n records from an API involves using HttpClient to send a GET request to the API. Here is a sample function which you can include in a C# console application or any other type of C# project:
csharp

using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            var records = await GetRecordsAsync(15);
            foreach (var record in records)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(record);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }

    public static async Task<string[]> GetRecordsAsync(int limit)
    {
        if (limit < 1)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("The limit should be at least 1");
        }

        using var httpClient = new HttpClient();
        var response = await httpClient.GetStringAsync($"https://api.yourwebsite.com/endpoint?limit={limit}");

        // Assuming the API returns a JSON array of strings. Adjust the deserialization as necessary based on the API's response format.
        var records = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<string[]>(response);
        
        return records.Length > limit ? records.Take(limit).ToArray() : records;
    }
}


In the above code:

We create an async method named GetRecordsAsync that accepts a limit as a parameter.
We use HttpClient to send a GET request to the API with the limit as a query parameter (replace 'https://api.yourwebsite.com/endpoint' with the actual API endpoint).
We deserialize the response JSON into a string array (assuming the API returns a JSON array of strings, adjust as necessary based on the API response format).
We return the first n records using Take(limit).
The Main method demonstrates how to call GetRecordsAsync and print the records.
You would need to install the Newtonsoft.Json package for JSON deserialization, which you can do via NuGet Package Manager or by using the following command in the Package Manager Console:

Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json

Remember to replace 'https://api.yourwebsite.com/endpoint' with the actual API endpoint and adjust the deserialization based on the API's response format.
