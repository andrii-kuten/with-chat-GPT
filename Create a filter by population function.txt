o	Create a function that accepts a number as an attribute and can filter by ` population `. 
o	The filter should search for countries where the population is less than provided number from attributes in the millions of people (e.g., by providing value `10`, I should find countries with a population less than 10m) using C#


To create a function in C# that accepts a number as an attribute and filters countries with a population less than the provided number (in millions), you can follow these steps:

Create a list of countries along with their populations (in millions).
Use a LINQ query or a loop to filter the countries based on the given population limit.
Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class Country
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double PopulationInMillions { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        List<Country> countries = new List<Country>
        {
            new Country { Name = "Country1", PopulationInMillions = 5.0 },
            new Country { Name = "Country2", PopulationInMillions = 10.5 },
            new Country { Name = "Country3", PopulationInMillions = 8.0 },
            new Country { Name = "Country4", PopulationInMillions = 3.5 }
        };

        double populationLimit = 10.0; // Set the population limit here
        FilterCountriesByPopulation(countries, populationLimit);
    }

    public static void FilterCountriesByPopulation(List<Country> countries, double populationLimit)
    {
        var filteredCountries = countries.Where(c => c.PopulationInMillions < populationLimit);

        foreach (var country in filteredCountries)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Country: {country.Name}, Population: {country.PopulationInMillions} million");
        }
    }
}


In this script:

We have created a Country class with properties Name and PopulationInMillions.
We have created a list of Country objects with hardcoded names and populations.
We have a function FilterCountriesByPopulation that takes a list of Country objects and a population limit, and filters the countries where the population is less than the provided limit. It then prints out the names and populations of the filtered countries.
You can modify the populationLimit variable in the Main method to test with different population limits.
